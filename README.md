# Notepad-using-Tkinter
Hello everyone, I had this as a course project this semester, to create a notepad using Python. I've used Python's Tkinter module to create this GUI based project. The idea was to match the original Window's Notepad and I think I was successful to some extent.  I do hope you'll find [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yygPOZ28Fxw) video helpful, in case you were looking for a project.
